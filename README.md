### Hi everyone 👋,

and welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am a self-taught creative coder and media artist. I use programming as a tool to explore and express my artistic vision. Here you'll find a collection of my projects.

#### I work as ...

🤪 ▷ an *artist*,   
🤑 ▷ a *developer*,   
😎 ▷ a *sound designer*.   
   
   
   
😇 I like to **collaborate**, **communicate**, **help** and **support** .   
   
🥸 I am always open to exchange ideas, work together and to collaborate on artistic projects and social projects with a positive effect on society.
